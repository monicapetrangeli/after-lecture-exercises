# after-lecture-exercises
the exercises of the first lecture have been added.

With regards to exercise 11 .upper() was used to ensure that letters within the decided range (a to f) even if inputted in lower cases would be accepted by the code.

For exercise 17 the first numbers are being transformed into a float as they would otherwise be stored as strings by the code and be unable to process for the mathematical operations.
